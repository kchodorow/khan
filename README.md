# KHAN

khan is genghis-khan's little brother: a replica set GUI for MongoDB.  It allows
you to easily set up a replica set.

## Getting Started

* Install pymongo (khan requires version 1.7+ and Python 2.5+):

        $ sudo easy_install pymongo

* Run `start` from this directory:

        $ ./start

* Start up your replica set servers.

* Go to [http://localhost:27080][2] in a web browser and fill out the 
information about your set.

## Problems?

Please let me know if you have any issues or suggestions!  I created this for my
own convenience, hopefully it will help some other people out, too.
